# Movie-Recommendation-system
The movie recommendation system using two types of filtering approach, content-based and collaborative. Datasets used :IMDB 250-movies data set, Kaggle 14000-movies data set and Movie lens 9000- movies data set. 

Area

Our area is Recommender Systems

Sub area

We would be using NLP with collaborative and content base filtering algorithm.

Description

Now a days the recommendation system is a crucial part of oneâ€™s life. The data set is filtered by the process of prediction of the preference of the users. The algorithm is based on collaborative and content-based filtering approach that makes use of the information provided by other users, analyses the data and then recommends the movies that is best suited to the user at that time.

Data Source
We would be using the data set from Kaggle, a web-based data science environment. We are planning to use:

1. Kaggle Movie Lens (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset):

This data set has 45000 movies released on and before July 2017. The data sets have various data points for example, cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, released dates, language, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote average. Data points collected is from 270000 users containing 26 million. The rating is on the scale of 1 to 5.

2. IMDB movie dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/imdbmovies):
This data set has 14762 movies. This data set is pre-processed and cleaned to be ready for the machine learning projects. The data set is also classified as content and genre.
